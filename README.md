# RSLT 
## RDF Stylesheet Language Transformations 

This is the repository for RSLT source code. RSLT (pronounced: _result_) stands for RDF Stylesheet Language Transformations, and it is a simple tool to create visual representations of RDF graphs with a syntax directly derived from XSLT. 

RSLT is a simple transformation language for RDF data. RSLT organizes rendering as transformation templates associated to resources, properties or resource types, produces HTML and can recursively call other templates. Here you can find a browser-based prototype using the AngularJs library to allow client-based presentations of SPARQL constructs, and soon of Turtle datasets as well.
